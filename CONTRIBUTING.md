### Pull Request Process (checklist)

1. Ensure that your code is clean of unused imports, dependencies and so on.
2. Increase the version numbers in any changed files to the new version that this Pull Request would represent. The
   versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
3. Please write proper KDoc for your additions. If your changes alter interactions with the library (ex.:
   deprecation, method refactoring, etc.)
4. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you do not have
   permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.
