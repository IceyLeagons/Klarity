Klarity is a lightweight internalization library for the Kotlin programming language, with support for JavaScript thanks to Kotlin Multiplatform.
It makes it super easy to create multi-lingual projects.

What it provides:
 - Script language to skyrocket the capabilities of translators
 - Simple yet powerful customization
 - Multiple built-in source support (properties, json)
 - Middlewares (for ex.: to add coloring in Minecraft server plugins)
 - Automatic file generation from default values
 - Basically no dependencies (except for some built-in file format supports)

So internalization becomes as simple and powerful as: 
```kotlin
Klarity.registerSource("en", PropertiesSource(Path.of("en.properties")))

println(
    Klarity.translate(
        "path.to.translation",
        "You have {IF(EQ(amount, '1'), IF(SW(item, 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'), 'an', 'a'), amount)} {item}{IF(GT(amount, '1'), 's', '')}",
        mapOf(
            Pair("amount", "2"),
            Pair("item", "apple")
        )
    )
)

// Output:
// Amount = 2, Item = apple --> You have 2 apples
// Amount = 1, Item = apple --> You have an apple
// Amount = 1, Item = pear --y You have a pear
```

## üíª Basic usage

To use Klarity, you will first have to install it via your build system of choice. I recommend Gradle.
```kts
repositories {
    maven("https://www.jitpack.io")
}

dependencies {
    implementation("net.iceyleagons:klarity:1.0.0")
}
```

After that's done, you will need to register one or more TranslationSources in the configuration DSL.
However if you don't want to do it just yet, you don't need to.
Klarity will just simply use the default values you've provided.

```kotlin
Klarity.configure {
    sourceManagement {
        registerSource("en", PropertiesSource(Path.of("en.properties")))
        registerSource("hu", PropertiesSource(Path.of("hu.properties")))

        // Or JSON
        registerSource("de", JsonSource(Path.of("de.json")))
    }
}
```

If that's done, you're ready to go, just use
```kotlin
val translation = Klarity.translate("path.to.translation", "Default value")

// Or with parameters
Klarity.translate("path.to.translation2", "Value is: {param}", mapOf(Pair("param", "something")))
```

However Klarity provides much more configuration to fine tune it to your use case!

```kotlin
Klarity.configure {
    defaultLanguage("hu") // (default: en)
    withScriptingEnabled(false) // (default: true)
    withGlobals {
        globalParameters {
            "appName" to "MyApp"
            "appVersion" to "1.0.0"
        }

        // Note that prefix and suffix are not parsed for the script!
        prefix("[MyApp] ")
        suffix(" [SUFFIX]")
    }
}
```

There are even more, take a look in Customizing for them :)

## üìú Understanding the script
If you have ever used Excel's formulas, this script will feel very similar.

In essence everything inside {} will be parsed by the parser (although you can escape it with \ ).
Anything inside ' ' will become a string (you cannot use "!)
Anything outside of ' ' will be considered as a parameter passed from the underlying code implementation.

To empower translators we've included many useful functions, but these are not limited, as Klarity
provides an API to register your own functions.

## üñåÔ∏è Customizing
Currently - due to time limits - other than the KDoc I will not supply a documentation for customization.
However, feel free to look at the built in features as an example.

You can customize Klarity in two different ways:
 - Adding custom translation sources
 - Adding new script functions
 - Add middlewares

### üóÇÔ∏è Translation Sources

Translation sources are responsible for retrieving the strings from whatever source, and to write default values (if supported).

To add a custom translation source, just implement the TranslationSource interface and register it via
```kotlin
Klarity.configure {
    sourceManagement {
        registerSource("en", source)
    }
}
```

### üì° Middlewares
Middlewares are codes that can modify the output of `Klarity.translate()` after the script has been parsed.
This could be useful to add custom parsing, for example adding color code support in Minecraft plugins. Additionally it can do filtering and verification as well. 

Please note, that whatever the middleware outputs will become the output of `Klarity.translate()`. There can also be multiple middlewares, they are
called in the order of registration. Every middleware will get the output of the previous one as an input.

To create a middleware, implement the KlarityMiddleware interface and register it via
```kotlin
Klarity.configure {
    pluginManagement {
        registerMiddleware(middleware)
    }
}
```

### üî§ Script functions

Script functions are the functions you can use inside the little scripting language. We've covered most of the useful functions, but who knows
maybe you come up with something really cool, in that case you can submit it to us via a PR. Of course you can have it remain private, if that what
you like, but we strongly recommend publishing it, so other translators can have much more power.

To create a function, simply implement the KlarityFunction abstract class. Since this class requires the ScriptParser instance, we have created an interface
called FunctionProvider to do that when creating a new ScriptParser instance.

To register your own script functions, simply call:

```kotlin
Klarity.configure {
    pluginManagement {
        registerFunction(FunctionProvider { YourFunction(it) })
    }
}
```
